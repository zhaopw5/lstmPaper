Wilcox Solar Observatory Polar Field Observations
These WSO data are intended to be the most untouched measure of the solar polar field strength, i.e. presented with the least possible amount of processing.WSO Polar Aperture
The Sun's Polar Field strength is measured in the polemost 3' apertures at WSO each day, north and south.

The polemost aperture measures the line-of-sight field between about 55 and the poles.

As Earth moves above and below the equator each year the solar coordinates of the apertures shift.

Depending on the observatory optics and the date, the square aperture at the pole will be oriented differently on the Sun during each measurement.

Each 10 days the usable daily polar field measurements in a centered 30-day window are averaged.

A 20nhz low pass filtered values eliminate yearly geometric projection effects.

Data are updated about once a month.
